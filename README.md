## EDA manufacturing project

### Project description
This project is to optimise a manufacturing machine process for a large industrial company. We extract data on the machine from an RDS database. The data is then cleaned, analysed and visualised. Conclusions are then drawn on how the machine can be run with minimal failures.

### Installation instructions

Clone the github repostory by running the following command in a terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/sgrayner/EDA-Manufacturing.git
```

### Data sources?

### Steps in EDA process?

### Usage instructions

The notebook file, (Notebook.ipynb) is the file that will walk you through the exploratory data analysis process. Run the code blocks from the beginning to run the EDA process on the data.

The df_utils.py file contains the functions for extracting, cleaning, analysing and visualising the data.
